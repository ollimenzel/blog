## Why Bother with Metadata?

Think of metadata as the DNA of your SharePoint content. It tells you who created a document, when it was last touched, and more. This information isnâ€™t just for kicks; it's vital for audits, compliance, and knowing the lineage of your content.

## Keeping Metadata Intact with Updates

Sometimes you need to adjust a document's details but want to keep the original 'Modified By' data. PnP PowerShell is your ally here:

```powershell
# Connect to your SharePoint site
Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demo -Interactive

# Preserve metadata with a SystemUpdate
Set-PnPListItem -List "Tasks" -Identity $item -Values @{
    "Title"="New Project Title"
    } -UpdateType SystemUpdate
```
## Understanding Update Types in PnP PowerShell
When you're updating SharePoint items with PnP PowerShell, you have three update methods at your disposal, each serving a different purpose. Let's demystify these:
1. **Update**
    
    This is the standard update command. When you use Update, SharePoint treats the action as if you manually updated the item through the UI. This means:
    
    The "Modified" and "Modified By" fields will be updated to reflect the time of the update and the user who made the change.
    If versioning is enabled on the list or library, a new version will be created.
    Use it when you want to make a straightforward update that logs your changes as a new version.
1. **SystemUpdate**
    
    SystemUpdate is more discreet:

    It updates items without changing the "Modified By" and "Modified" fields.
    A new version is created if versioning is enabled, but it will not show as a new "modified" entry.
    This method is perfect when you need to make changes that don't affect the item's version history as seen by end-users, like during system migrations or bulk updates.
1. **UpdateOverwriteVersion**
    
    The UpdateOverwriteVersion is the stealth operator:

    It updates the item while keeping the "Modified By" and "Modified" fields as they were.
    It does not create a new version; instead, it overwrites the current version, even if versioning is enabled.
    This approach is suitable when you want to make a correction to the current version of an item or document without increasing the version count, effectively keeping the update under the radar.

## Changing Creator and Creation Dates: Is It Even Possible?

Yes, it is! Adjusting the creator or creation date of a document is sometimes necessary, such as during migrations or clean-ups. Here's how you can accomplish this:

```powershell
# Fetch the item you need to update
$item = Get-PnPListItem -List "Documents" -Id 42

# Change the "Created By" and "Created" fields
$creationDate = Get-Date "2020-01-14"
Set-PnPListItem -List "Documents" -Identity $item -Values @{
    "Author" = $newCreatorUserId;
    "Created" = $creationDate
} -SystemUpdate
```

## Data Integrity Best Practices

To safeguard your SharePoint content during updates, here are some best practices to uphold data integrity:

- Maintain a Change Log: Documenting changes ensures accountability and traceability.
- Secure Approvals: Validate that all updates are authorized and documented.
- Test Before Implementing: Always preview changes in a safe environment to prevent unintended consequences in your live content.

## Conclusion
With PnP PowerShell, you have the tools to adjust metadata with precision, ensuring that your SharePoint data tells its true story without unintended revisions. It's about strategic changes that respect the narrative of your data.
