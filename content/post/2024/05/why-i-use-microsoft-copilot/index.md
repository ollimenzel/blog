I tried out a lot of LLM's over time (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and personally still prefer using Microsoft Copilot over the others for multiple reasons. 
Copilot is an innovative AI assistant, offering a plethora of features that cater to a wide spectrum of online activities. 
In my view the free version of Copilot is particularly noteworthy for its versatility and user-friendly approach even compared to other paid AI assistants. Everything I will mention here is based on the free version of Copilot. So you can try it out without any costs.
Let's delve into the topics that make Copilot my preferred choice:

### **Real-Time Information Access**
Copilot's seamless integration with Bing search technology ensures that users have access to information that is current and relevant. This feature is invaluable for professionals who require up-to-date data to make informed decisions.

### **Source-Cited Responses**
Copilot enhances the reliability of its information by providing footnotes with sources, akin to a well-researched article. This level of transparency is crucial for users who need to trace the origin of the information for academic or professional purposes.

### **Enhanced AI Performance**
At its core, Copilot is equipped with GPT-4 Turbo, an AI model that offers a significant leap in performance over its predecessors. This advancement translates to a more intuitive user experience, with responses that are contextually aware and richly detailed.

### **Diverse Input Methods**
Copilot's ability to process both voice and image inputs marks a significant step forward in AI interaction. Users can engage with Copilot in a manner that best suits their preferences or situational needs, be it through spoken commands or visual queries.

### **Browser Integration for Convenience**
The integration of Copilot directly into the Edge web browser (my go-to browser) makes it easy to it, allowing users to summon assistance without interrupting their online journey. 
This feature is particularly beneficial for those who multitask or require quick information retrieval.
Here in particular I like the fact: 
- That I can use Copilot to generate summaries of articles I'm reading 
- Summarize files that I opened in the browser, like Office documents or PDFs. 
- Use Copilot to summarize a YouTube video as long as it has subtitles.

### **Creative Image Generation**
Copilot's image generation capability allows you to bring your creative visions to life. As someone who isn't very good at drawing, I find this feature particularly useful.
Describe a concept, and Copilot will translate it into a visual representation, offering a new dimension to content creation and design. The model used for this is DALL-E 3.
Another benefit of using Copilot is that Copilot is creating 4 different images at once, so you can choose the one that fits your needs best. Those image(s) can then also be used in Microsoft Designer very easily.

### **Intelligent Image Analysis**
The addition of image analysis to Copilot's skill set further extends its utility. Users can upload images for analysis, receiving detailed insights and information, which is especially useful for educational, professional, and personal explorations.
