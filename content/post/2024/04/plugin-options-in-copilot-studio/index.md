Hey folks, Daniel here, and today we're diving deep into the world of Microsoft Copilot Studio plugins. If you've ever found yourself scratching your head, wondering about the different plugin options available in Copilot Studio and how you can use them to supercharge your Microsoft 365 Copilot, you're in the right place. Plus, I've got a cool trick up my sleeve involving a rebrickable connector for all you LEGO enthusiasts out there. So, buckle up because we're about to unravel the mysteries of Copilot Studio plugins together.

First things first, let's talk about the two main types of plugins you'll encounter in Copilot Studio: AI plugins and conversational plugins. If you've played around with Power Virtual Agents before, conversational plugins will feel like a familiar friend. Essentially, they allow you to provide descriptive text to the copilot, similar to how you used to create topics in Power Virtual Agents. It's not a brand-new concept, but it's been enhanced to make your Copilot even more functional.

Now, onto the AI plugins, which are a bit more diverse and can be broken down into four subcategories. You might already be familiar with AI Builder prompts from working with Power Automate Cloudflows. Then there are custom connectors, which you may have used or created before. The real game-changer here is the integration of open AI plugins â€“ a fresh addition that taps into the power of ChatGPT and opens up a whole new world of possibilities.

But wait, there's more! Let's clear up any confusion between conversational plugins and plugin actions. While they might sound similar, they serve different purposes. Conversational plugins are designed to extend your Microsoft Copilot, allowing you to create them in Copilot Studio and then use them within your Microsoft 365 Copilot. However, they come with some limitations, like not supporting rich text formatting or multi-turn interactions, and they can only be built at a per-Copilot level.

On the other hand, plugin actions are like the secret sauce that can make your life a whole lot easier. You can create a single plugin action and use it across multiple topics, saving you time and effort. What's cool about plugin actions is that they can handle both input and output, essentially doing the job of two nodes in one. Just like conversational plugins, they're built at a per-Copilot level.

Now, let's get hands-on and explore how these plugins function within Copilot Studio. When you're in the studio, you can easily access AI plugins, including those nifty AI Builder, custom connectors, and the shiny new open AI plugins. But to play with conversational plugins, you'll need to dive into an existing copilot.

One of the coolest examples I've got to show you involves using a conversational plugin with the rebrickable connector to fetch information about LEGO parts by their part number. It's a simple yet powerful way to enhance your interactions with end users, providing them with detailed info about LEGO parts directly within your conversation.

And let's not forget about plugin actions. By creating a plugin action, you can streamline your workflow by reusing it across multiple topics, eliminating the need to build the same nodes over and over again. This is especially handy when you're dealing with repetitive tasks, like fetching LEGO part details, as I demonstrated with the rebrickable connector.

So there you have it, a comprehensive guide to navigating the world of Copilot Studio plugins. Whether you're enhancing your Microsoft 365 Copilot with conversational plugins or saving time with plugin actions, the possibilities are endless. And remember, the key to unlocking the full potential of Copilot Studio lies in understanding and leveraging these plugins to your advantage.
